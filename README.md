# Garbage-Disposal-System (IoT)
Smart Waste Management System is necessary for improved Life Quality Index. This is done as a part of design and fabrication project of my B.E Mechatronics curriculum for us to get started with designing and fabricating useful systems. The fabricated garbage disposal systems'working goes like:
1) Detects the presence of waste material to be put inside.
2) Check whether the waste is of dry type or wet type.
3) Motor rotates to the side of identified type of waste.
4) The system checks whether the waste level has reached the threshold in any of the half (Dry waste / Wet Waste).
5) If the threshold is reached, the system alerts the personnel or authorities in charge via SMS and App Notification.
   
The project is titled as "Electrically Actatuated Garbage Disposal System with Automated Alerts" in the motive of including a sealing mechanism which may need more power than the other components. The sealing mechanism would seal the garbage bag inside once it reaches the maximum level and hence avoid issues like spread of epidermics and foul smell in the environment. For more details, DM me.
